This binding makes [ESPHome](https://esphome.io) devices available in openHAB through the ESPHome Home Assistant Native
API. This is an
alternative to using MQTT and/or running Home Assistant in addition to openHAB.

It does _NOT_ provide any webpage for managing the ESP themselves. Use
the [ESPHome dashboard](https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome.html) for that.

Benefits of using the native API over MQTT:

- Very tight integration with openHAB, state patterns, options, icons etc fully integrated
- Robust and reliable communication - 2 way keep-alive pings at fairly short intervals lets you know if the device has
  gone offline
- No need for an MQTT broker (but that is nice to have anyway for other things :))
- Slightly faster than messaging over MQTT (according to the ESPHome documentation)

## Getting started for non ESPHome users

1. [Install ESPHome](https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome)
2. Create an ESPHome configuration for your device
3. Flash the device with the ESPHome firmware
4. Install the openHAB ESPHome binding by copying the jar file
   here https://github.com/seime/openhab-esphome/releases/tag/latest_oh4 into your `addons` folder, or by installing
   from the Marketplace https://community.openhab.org/t/esphome-binding-for-the-native-api/146849
5. Wait for discovery to find your device - or add manually in a thing file.

> **Note:** Remember to edit your things and add the `encryptionKey` .

## Discovery

The binding uses mDNS to automatically discover devices on the network.

## Binding Configuration

It is possible to set a default encryption key for all devices in the binding configuration. This is useful if you
have a lot of devices using the same encryption key. If you are using file based config, add

```
binding.esphome:defaultEncryptionKey=<BASE64ENCODEDKEY>
```

to `$OH_CONFDIR/services/runtime.cfg` .

## Channels

Channels are auto-generated based on actual device configuration. Bring the device online, and the binding will
interrogate the device and create channels based on the device configuration.

## FAQ

### My hostname field suddenly changed to xxxx.local?

> Openhab updates thing configuration based on mDNS messages. There is currently no way to avoid this, but there are 2
> workarounds:
> * Use a different thingUID from the one discovered, ie `esphome:device:fridge` -> `esphome:device:fridge-esp`
> * Use file based configuration as they are read-only
    > See https://github.com/seime/openhab-esphome/issues/1 . TLDR: A "feature" in openHAB.

### I cannot connect to my device

I get errors like
```[WARN ] [phome.internal.handler.ESPHomeHandler] - [mydevice] Error initial connection no.seime.openhab.binding.esphome.internal.comm.ProtocolAPIError: Failed to connect to 'XXXX.local.' port 6053```
> See previous question

### openHAB loose connection to my device

with log messages like
`[WARN ] [home.internal.handler.ESPHomeHandler] - [esphome-deviceId] Ping responses lacking. Waited 4 times 10 seconds, total of 40. Assuming connection lost and disconnecting`
`[INFO ] [ESPHome Socket Reader] [home.internal.comm.ESPHomeConnection] - [esphome-deviceId] Disconnecting socket.`

> This can be caused by a flaky device or network connection. It can also be caused by device overload, causing it to
> drop messages. If you are using the have a lot of chatty devices or using the bluetooth proxy, the ESP might overload
> it's TCP
> send buffer. To check if this is your problem, set the `api` component logger to `VERBOSE` and look for
`Cannot send message because of TCP buffer space`.
> If this happens, get a more powerful ESP or reduce how often it sends data.

> If you have the `uptime` sensor in your ESPHome configuration, you can use that to monitor the device uptime. If the
> device uptime is increasing while openHAB reports the device as offline, it is likely a network issue.

### I get warnings like

`Unit 'XXXX' unknown to openHAB, returning DecimalType for state '1234.0' on channel 'esphome:device:8dcf64d482:my_channel_name`

> The unit is reported by the ESPHome device, but it doesn't match anything known to openHAB.
>
> Solution: Add a valid `unit_of_measurement` to your entity in the ESPHome configuration. Use `unit_of_measurement: ""`
> to remove the unit altogether from the entity.

### I get warnings like

`No device_class reported by sensor '<name of sensor>'. Add device_class to sensor configuration in ESPHome. Defaulting to plain Number without dimension`

> This is because the ESP sensor does not report a `device_class`. This field is used to determine item and category

## Bluetooth proxy support

It is now possible to use the built-in Bluetooth proxy in ESPHome. This allows you to use ESPHome devices as proxies
for other Bluetooth devices such as BTHome sensors or a range of other Bluetooth devices.

> NOTE: Only beacons / devices broadcasting data are supported at the moment. Connectable devices will be supported in a
> future release.

> NOTE: The proxy bridge *CANNOT* be created in the UI, you *must* file based configuration!

The feature is still experimental and may not work as expected.

1. Configure the ESPHome device with the `bluetooth_proxy` component. See https://esphome.io/components/bluetooth_proxy

```yaml
bluetooth_proxy:
  active: true
```

2. Configure the ESPHome `device` in openHAB with `enableBluetoothProxy = true`

```yaml
esphome:device:garage-opener  "Garage ESP32" [ ... enableBluetoothProxy=true ]
```

3. Configure a Bluetooth Proxy bridge of type `esphome`

This is the standard configuration for any type of Bluetooth adapter in openHAB (not documented elsewhere)

| Name                             | Type      | Description                                                                 | Default | Required | Advanced |
|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|----------|
| `backgroundDiscovery`            | `boolean` | Add discovered device automatically to tihe inbox in the background         | false   | no       | no       |
| `inactiveDeviceCleanupInterval`  | `integer` | Number of seconds of Bluetooth device inactivity before removing from inbox | 60      | no       | no       |
| `inactiveDeviceCleanupThreshold` | `integer` |                                                                             | 300     | no       | no       |

```
Bridge bluetooth:esphome:proxy "ESPHome BLE Advertisement listener" [backgroundDiscovery = false] {
    bthome parasite1 "b-Parasite #4354" [address="XX:XX:XX:XX:18:91", expectedReportingIntervalSeconds = 600]
}
```

> **NOTE:** Set backgroundDiscovery to true if you want to automatically add discovered devices to the inbox. If not use
> manual scanning from the inbox.

## Streaming logs from ESPHome device to openHAB

As an alternative to manually streaming device logs via ESPHome dashboard, you can have openHAB stream
the device logs directly to openHAB - which will write them using the standard log system.

1. Make sure your ESPHome yaml is configured with a log level that produces the logs you want to see.
   See https://esphome.io/components/logger.html
2. Configure the `deviceLogLevel` parameter on the `thing` configuration. Valid
   values: https://esphome.io/components/logger.html#log-levels
3. The default log level in openHAB is `WARN`, so you need to add a logger named `ESPHOMEDEVICE`with level `INFO` to see
   actual log statements. Either add this to your `log4j.xml` file or use the Karaf console:

```
log:set INFO ESPHOMEDEVICE
```

**or**

```xml

<Loggers>
    ...
    <Logger level="DEBUG" name="ESPHOMEDEVICE"/>
</Loggers>
```

This will produce logs on level `INFO` in the openHAB logs like this:

```
[2024-04-04 15:06:25.822] [boiler] [D][dallas.sensor:143]: 'VV Temp bottom': Got Temperature=21.0°C
[2024-04-04 15:06:25.834] [boiler] [D][sensor:094]: 'VV Temp bottom': Sending state 21.00000 °C with 1 decimals of accuracy
[2024-04-04 15:06:25.850] [boiler] [D][dallas.sensor:143]: 'VV Temp middle': Got Temperature=71.7°C 
[2024-04-04 15:06:25.863] [boiler] [D][sensor:094]: 'VV Temp middle': Sending state 71.68750 °C with 1 decimals of accuracy
```

To redirect device logs to a separate log file, edit your `log4j.xml` file and add the following in the `<Appenders>`
section:

```xml

<RollingFile fileName="${sys:openhab.logdir}/esphomedevice.log"
             filePattern="${sys:openhab.logdir}/esphomedevice.log.%i" name="ESPHOMEDEVICE">
    <PatternLayout pattern="[%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}] %m%n"/>
    <Policies>
        <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="32 MB"/>
    </Policies>
</RollingFile>
```

And add the following in the `Loggers` section:

```xml

<Logger additivity="false" level="INFO" name="ESPHOMEDEVICE">
    <AppenderRef ref="ESPHOMEDEVICE"/>
</Logger>
```

## Sending state from openHAB to ESPHome

You can send state to the ESPHome device using the `homeassistant` sensor type. Only `entity_id` field is used.

You can listen for several types of OpenHAB events, default is `ItemStateChangedEvent`. The following are supported:

| entity_id                                  | OH Event listened for         | Item/Thing   |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| `<whatever>.ItemName`                      | `ItemStateChangedEvent`       | ItemName     | 
| `ItemStateChangedEvent.ItemName`           | `ItemStateChangedEvent`       | ItemName     | 
| `ItemStateEvent.ItemName`                  | `ItemStateEvent`              | ItemName     | 
| `ItemStateUpdatedEvent.ItemName`           | `ItemStateUpdatedEvent`       | ItemName     | 
| `ItemStatePredictedEvent.ItemName`         | `ItemStatePredictedEvent`     | ItemName     | 
| `GroupItemStateChangedEvent.ItemName`      | `GroupItemStateChangedEvent`  | ItemName     | 
| `GroupStateUpdatedEvent.ItemName`          | `GroupStateUpdatedEvent`      | ItemName     | 
| `ThingStatusInfoEvent.my_thing_uid`        | `ThingStatusInfoEvent`        | my:thing:uid | 
| `ThingStatusInfoChangedEvent.my_thing_uid` | `ThingStatusInfoChangedEvent` | my:thing:uid | 

> NOTE: EntityID in HA is case-insensitive - meaning only lowercase is used. Whatever you add in `entity_id` in the
> ESPHome yaml will be converted to lowercase.
> In OH item names are case-sensitive, so you can have 2 items like `MYITEM` and `MyItem`, and we cannot distinguish
> between the 2. Avoid this setup.

> NOTE2: In Thing UIDs, the `:` is replaced with `_`

> NOTE3: For Group events, it is the group state that is sent, not the individual item states.

### Examples

Making state changes to OH temperature sensor available in ESPHome:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    name: "Outside temperature"
    entity_id: ItemStateChangedEvent.MyTemperatureItem
    device_class: temperature
```

Listening for commands sent from OH to some OH item and making it available in ESPHome:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    name: "Flower watering activating"
    entity_id: ItemCommandEvent.WaterValve_Switch
```

Making ESPHome device react when a Thing changes status, ie goes offline/online:

```yaml
text_sensor:
  - platform: homeassistant
    name: "ThingStatusInfoChangedEvent"
    entity_id: ThingStatusInfoChangedEvent.astro_moon_local
```

## Time sync from openHAB

Time sync from your openHAB server is supported using
the [HomeAssistant time source component](https://esphome.io/components/time/homeassistant).

```yaml
time:
  - platform: homeassistant
    id: openhab_time
```

## Actions and Events

To process actions and events sent via the [Native API Component's actions](https://esphome.io/components/api/#api-actions), the binding adds three new trigger types accessible via UI rules:

![New Triggers](triggers.png)

Be sure to enable `allowActions` in the Thing configuration so that openHAB will request the device to send events.
The event object has `getData`, `getDataTemplate`, and `getVariables` methods to access the appropriate information for action and event events.
For tag scanned events, the event's payload is the tag ID.
The event's source will be of the form `no.seime.openhab.binding.openhab$<device_id>`, where device_id is the ESPHome device ID that sent the event.

Unfortunately, these triggers are not available from Rules DSL, but some other openHAB automation languages may support setting triggers based on any event sent through the [event bus](https://www.openhab.org/docs/developer/utils/events.html).
To listen for these events, they look like this:

| ESPHome Action              | Topic                             | Event Type                | Payload                                                                |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `homeassistant.action`      | `openhab/esphome/action/<action>` | `esphome.ActionEvent`     | JSON object with "data", "data_template", and "variables" sub-objects. |
| `homeassistant.event`       | `openhab/esphome/event/<event>`   | `esphome.EventEvent`      | JSON object with "data", "data_template", and "variables" sub-objects. |
| `homeassistant.tag_scanned` | `openhab/esphome/tag_scanned`     | `esphome.TagScannedEvent` | The tag id.                                                            |

For JRuby, use the [`event` trigger](https://openhab.github.io/openhab-jruby/main/OpenHAB/DSL/Rules/BuilderDSL.html#event-instance_method).
For Python Scripting, use [`GenericEventTrigger`](https://www.openhab.org/addons/automation/pythonscripting/#module-openhab-triggers).

## Limitations

Most entity types and functions are now supported. However, there are some limitations:

The following entity types are **not** yet supported (please submit a PR of file a feature request!)

- `camera`
- `voice`
- `valve`
- `siren`

- `light` - not all modes are supported. Please create a PR if you need a specific mode.

In addition, the Bluetooth proxy isn't fully ready yet.
